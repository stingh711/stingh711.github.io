      <description>This is the first blog post from ox-hugo.
I&amp;rsquo;m using org-roam now. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to keep my note in org-roam and use these notes to compose my blog posts. I try to use ox-hugo so that I can keep the source files in org format and keep them in my database.
Moreover, I can copy the content from my roam notes.
What will happen if I link another note?</description>

      <description>I used to use bear as my note taking app. However, as the roam reseach began to get popular, I switched to org-roam, a great emacs extension. It is base on org mode, so the edit feature is really powerful.
However, it is still an editor, not an delicated note app. Some features are not easy to use. For example, seaching or just skiming some notes. The graphing feature of roam research is also needing improving.</description>
