<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve bean using java and python for years. With spring boot, it is easy to start an application. However, I still don&rsquo;t like the database access part of java.</p>
<p>Now JPA and mybatis are popular solutions for database access. When I need to write some queries with dynamic conditions, the code is still ugly.</p>
<p>In my recent projects, because we have very limited resource (Only 1 developer for both API and frontend), I begin to use Django and Django rest framework to replace spring boot.</p>
<p>Actually, most of our APIs are just simple CRUD. With Django rest framework and django-filter, I only need a few lines of codes to get the API done.</p>
<p>One of our applications is to collect data from some machine tools, do some calculation and show some reports. It suppports uploading data through both some HTTP endpoints and MQTT.</p>
<p>For MQTT, integrating MQTT with Django is difficult. So I use hbmqtt and another simple python file to receive the data from mosquitto. Because we only need to collect data from a few machine tools (&lt; 10), this file is enough.</p>
<p>However, we just got a big project which has about 100 machine tools and more than 1000 data points (Some data points' sampling rate is 100Hz). Then I begin to worry about the performance of this python file. I decide to give golang a try because it is hot recently.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-like">Things I like</h2>
<ol>
<li>Simple. The core of the language is simple enough just like C.</li>
<li>Flexible. Don&rsquo;t have the limitation like &ldquo;one public class in one file&rdquo;, so with only one or two files, you can get a fully workable application.</li>
<li>Static typed. Feel more confident to change my code than python.</li>
<li>Can build to a single executable file. It is so easy to deploy.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t need a heavy IDE to write code. I can use my favorite emacs now.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="things-i-dont-like">Things I don&rsquo;t like</h2>
<ol>
<li>Because I only use C during my college, the pointer is a little confusing for me</li>
<li>For a modern language, golang is a little dull. No list comprehension, no pattern match, if err != nil is everywhere</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t understand how defer works. Java&rsquo;s finally block is more clear</li>
<li>math.Round only works for float64. I have to change all float32 fields of my models to float64</li>
<li>There is no time struct like python&rsquo;s time and java&rsquo;s LocalTime</li>
</ol>
<p>After some google works, I&rsquo;m able to make my golang version MQTT receiver works. Just as the saying goes, it just works.</p>
