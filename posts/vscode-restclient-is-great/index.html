    </header><p>Postman is an essential tool for the development of both frontend and backend. However, sometimes I hate its save function. I hate to find a right folder to save a request. What I need is just a very simple tool to test some API and it will be just there when I need it. Then I found REST Client extension for Vscode.</p>
<p>With this extension, you can save your request in plain text. You can use vscode to edit it (Syntax highlight and indent is well supported) and then just run it in vscode too. You don&rsquo;t need to think which folder should I put this request, just write it down in a text file.</p>
<p>Actually, there is a same extension for emacs, but it doesn&rsquo;t work on my windows and I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
