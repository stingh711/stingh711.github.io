Evil mode is powerful but slow. It conflits with the keybindings of some customized modes, like howm or zk&rsquo;s index mode.
Second, it is difficult to customize for my poor knowledge of elisp.
Last, I only use emacs for note taking, and I don&rsquo;t need the power of evil mode. I don&rsquo;t do complex editing, so meow is a good choice.
After read meow-tutor several times and do some customization of key mappings, I am quite happy with meow.">
